# Developer Tools Integration

Your audio transcript analysis app now includes three integrated developer tools that have access to the same environment as your application:

## üîß Integrated IDE (`/ide`)

A full-featured web-based IDE powered by Monaco Editor (the same editor used in VS Code).

### Features:
- **File Explorer**: Browse and manage files in your project directory
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML, and more
- **Auto-save**: Files are automatically saved after 1 second of inactivity
- **Multiple Tabs**: Work with multiple files simultaneously
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+S`: Save current file
  - `Ctrl+N`: Create new file
- **Real-time Editing**: Full IntelliSense and code completion

### Security:
- File access is restricted to your application directory
- Cannot access files outside the project root

## üíª Web Terminal (`/terminal`)

A full-featured terminal emulator that runs in your browser with access to the same shell environment as your app.

### Features:
- **Real-time Terminal**: Full bash shell with pseudo-terminal support
- **Copy/Paste**: Right-click to copy, `Ctrl+V` to paste
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatically reconnects if connection is lost
- **Full Shell Access**: Same environment as your application
- **Color Support**: Full ANSI color and terminal formatting

### Available Commands:
All standard Unix commands are available:
- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `vim`, `nano`
- `python`, `pip`, `git`
- `htop`, `ps`, `grep`, `find`
- Package management and development tools

## üåê Embedded Browser (`/browser`)

A web browser that runs within your application, perfect for testing and browsing documentation.

### Features:
- **Full Navigation**: Back, forward, refresh, home buttons
- **Address Bar**: Enter URLs or search terms
- **Quick Bookmarks**: Pre-configured links to common development resources
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+L`: Focus address bar
  - `Ctrl+R`: Refresh page
  - `Alt+Left`: Go back
  - `Alt+Right`: Go forward
- **Local Testing**: Easy access to your running application on localhost

### Pre-configured Bookmarks:
- Google
- GitHub
- Stack Overflow
- Your Local App (localhost:8000)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start your application** as usual
2. **Navigate to the tools** using the navigation buttons in the header
3. **Use the IDE** to edit your code in real-time
4. **Use the Terminal** to run commands, install packages, or manage your application
5. **Use the Browser** to test your changes or access documentation

## üîí Security

All tools are designed with security in mind:
- File operations are sandboxed to your project directory
- Terminal access is isolated to your application environment
- Browser runs in a sandboxed iframe

## üê≥ Docker Compatibility

All tools work seamlessly in Docker environments:
- The terminal provides access to the container environment
- File operations work with mounted volumes
- Browser can access both internal and external resources

## üìù Example Workflow

1. **Edit Code**: Use the IDE to modify your Python files
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the terminal to run `pip install package_name`
3. **Test Changes**: Use the browser to navigate to `localhost:8000` and test your app
4. **Debug**: Use the terminal to check logs or run debugging commands
5. **Commit Changes**: Use the terminal to commit your changes with git

## üéØ Tips & Tricks

- **Multi-tool Workflow**: Open multiple browser tabs to use IDE, terminal, and browser simultaneously
- **File Sync**: Changes made in the IDE are immediately available to your running application
- **Terminal History**: Use up/down arrows to navigate command history
- **Browser Testing**: Use the browser to test API endpoints and view responses
- **Quick Navigation**: Use the navigation buttons to quickly switch between tools

These integrated tools provide a complete development environment within your web browser, eliminating the need for separate applications and providing seamless integration with your audio transcript analysis app.
